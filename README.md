I am currently in the process of learning Python.  I will document what I learn,
as I learn it in this GitHub project.

This Project will cover the following items:
1. Easy to follow examples of basic Python usage.
2. Exercise implementations.
3. Course Project implementations.

Course Information:
I am taking the following course from UDEMY:
https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/

I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning Python.  I do not
claim ownership of any of the material used from the course.  I am producing this
content for Educational purposes only.
